# Camunda Tasklist Processtree Plugin
A plugin for the task list which visualizes a process tree of the process instance hierarchies based on the call activity dependencies.

This plugin shows running and completed process instances in different colors:

* running: BLUE
* incidents: RED
* finished: GREEN

## How to use it?
### Build from Source
You can use `ant` to build and install the plugin to an existing Cockpit
inside an application server.
For that to work you need to copy the file `build.properties.example` to `build.properties`
and configure the path to your application server inside it.
Alternatively, you can also copy it to `${user.home}/.camunda/build.properties`
to have a central configuration that works with all projects generated by the
[Camunda BPM Maven Archetypes](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-maven-project-templates-archetypes).

Once you installed the plugin it should appear in
[Camunda Cockpit](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#cockpit).

### Install from camunda plugin store
Visit the [camunda Plugin Store](http://camunda.org/plugins/) and follow the installation instructions.
